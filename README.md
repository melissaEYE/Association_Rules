Apriori Association Rule analysis on lung resections surgery.

The dataset used for this project was the thoracic surgery data set from Wroclaw Thoracic Surgery Centre. https://github.com/melissaEYE/Association_Rules/blob/main/ThoraricSurgerery.csv

The objective of the analysis was to determine co-morbid symptoms for patients who had lung cancer and were required to undergo a lung resection. Understanding which symptoms to be co-morbid can help to improve patient care and medicine prescription. The type of analysis is association rule learning, whereby associations, or sets of frequent items, between variables are explored to try and find insights and hidden relationships in large datasets (Han, Kamber, Pei, 2011). One example may be, that a person who smokes (lhs, antecedent), is frequently coupled with a symptom of cough and weakness (rhs, consequent). 

This project involves using R to examine a dataset. My analysis involves creating Apriori association rule learning to help understand how the many variables, occur together which is difficult to do by simply looking at the dataset. 

The full report can be found in the file "Apriori Association Rules Assignment.pdf". This report shows a complete breakdown of my analysis, including problem identification, motivation, data exploration, data preparation, rules, results, and interpretations. Tables and visualizations are also included.

The R script is included in the file "MHunfalvay_Assignment1.R". Instructions on how to use the program are included as comments in the R file. After opening the file, please read the instructions carefully before executing the code to ensure that the program functions correctly.
